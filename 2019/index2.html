    I'm impressed that a company the size of WalMart can give such a terrible experience on the web.

    If someone is selling you hardware that has a kill switch for a camera, network access, etc. you still have to trust them that it works.

    If everyday you say the world is ending, it doesn't mean that you were right when that day comes.

    Dear Apple,

    I've tried to stick with you. But seriously, $1000 for a monitor stand? Because the monitor just doesn't come with one?

    Does no one know what the word "empathy" means?

    Be thankful for what you have and stop complaining about the weather.

    At some point in your life there are times that you just have to admit defeat. It happens more often than you'd like. senseantisense.com

    Even after watching "Interstellar" again I still don't understand the point of leaving Earth to start over. As if humans will be any different and not destroy their new environment. A Godless society is Godless wherever it lives.

    Children are starving. Women are starving. Men are starving. All 3 are being murdered. Poverty continues as the rich get richer and buy statues of silver rabbits. And in my world people are wanting to use an accordion on their website.

    "We live in dangerous times." Seriously? If you're going to use that lyric there's no way I'm listening to the song.

    Am I the only one who notices how schools are failing students? Not just in poor education but in the lack of privacy given to students. Notice, I'm not saying who is to blame.

    It's more than open source, it's free software.
