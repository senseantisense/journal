    <h2>20 Years for What?</h2>
    <time><p>6 December 2019</p></time>
    <p>Next year will be the twentieth year blogging. So much said and lost, but what was it all for? To humor the ego? To give me something to do? Hopefully to improve writing skills. After all that time, still no clear direction (oh, you’re eclectic) nor readers.</p>
    <p>And still, I write.</p>

    <h2>Leaders</h2>
    <time><p>23 August 2019</p></time>
    <p>I used to be a leader. I used to watch and read Tom Peters, a lot. It's still in me somewhere.
    I'd really like to meet a leader.  A leader like <a href="http://www.senseantisense.com/watch-listen-think-learn/tom-peters.php">Tom Peters</a> and <a href="http://www.senseantisense.com/watch-listen-think-learn/simon-sinek.php">Simeon Sinek</a> talk about.
  Maybe even work for a leader. Any takers out there?</p>

    <h2>More DK Syndrome</h2>
    <time><p>29 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>I hadn't thought that Dunning-Kruger (DK) dealt exclusively with "dumb"
    people, but by the quotes from the Washinton Post article, I'm glad this
  blog post by Dr. Novella was written to clarify. - <a href="https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/misunderstanding-dunning-kruger/">Misunderstanding Dunning-Kruger</a></p>

    <h2>Dream(s)</h2>
    <time><p>24 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>I want to have dreams again. The childhood ideal of what you want
    to do with your life. The thought that anything is possible.  Or that
  people will be there for you. The dream that adulthood means people are
mature and want to work together. That dream. The dream of childhood. The
lie adults tell you of childhood's future.</p>

    <h2>Smoking and Gas</h2>
    <time><p>22 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>Doesn't matter what the sign says at number 4.  No smoking at the gas pump
    means no smoking at the gas pump.</p>

    <h2>Mother Concerns</h2>
    <time><p>19 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>It depends on what month of the pregnancy. In the third trimester there
    was some difficulty sitting up. Rolling over was not an option. Walking
  was a bit painful but talking was never a problem.</p>

    <h2>Coloring</h2>
    <time><p>11 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>A person I know, let's call her Kat, was talking to a human resources consultant about their
    work environment. Kat said that when they are in a meeting, which is made up mainly
  of management, she'll express her professional opinion based on her field of knowledge.
    One of two things will occur, sometimes both:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The room goes quiet and someone changes the topic.</li>
      <li>They are told they are wrong by unknowledgeable people.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The HR consultant said that is called "shut-up and color".  Kat says
      she'll always remember that after she expresses herself.</p>

    <h2>Project Failure</h2>
    <time><p>11 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>I've been told you can learn from your failures.  I'm just not sure not sure everyone else was told that.  It's disheartening seeing a project fail and trying the best you can to stop it from failing.  At some point though, you have to realize the inevitable and accept it for what it is: a failing project.</p>
    <p>So why will the project fail?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There is no leader.  A leader doesn’t have to know the ins-and-outs of the technology that’s being used or how the design systems work.  A leader needs to know how to organize the people, encourage the people, and remove the obstacles to getting things done.  The leader needs to pick the right team members.</li>
      <li>The team members. The members don’t have the knowledge base to even begin or build the product. They are going with their own viewpoint and not what their audience needs or wants. The team members look for a solution that will work for them.  They take on tasks they don’t know how to do, don’t ask for help (or when they do they tell the expert they are wrong), and forget that they were supposed to be in charge of a task.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is the formula for failure and it occurs over and over again with no lessons learned. The same path is taken and every time different results are expected but the same result always occurs. They never were never told that you are supposed to learn from failure.</p>

    <h2>Awkward Design</h2>
    <time><p>10 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>Sometimes you're just in a hurry to design and don't realize that the
      spotlight is in an awkward position. Found this one at a family restaurant.</p>

    <h2>James 1:19-20 | NIV</h2>
    <time><p>2 July 2019</p></time>
    <p>My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick
      to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger
      does not produce the righteousness that God desires.</p>
