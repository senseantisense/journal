<ul>
<li>&quot;The way we think about the world affects the relationships we have with others and ourselves. By injecting a secret meaning into every event and experience, ideological movements are forced to change reality in accordance with their claims once they come to power. And this means that one can no longer trust the reality of oneâ€™s own lived experiences in the world. Instead, one is taught to distrust oneself and others, and to always rely upon the ideology of the movement, which must be right.&quot; - <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/for-hannah-arendt-totalitarianism-is-rooted-in-loneliness">Where loneliness can lead</a></li>
<li>Very still and quiet day. Yet, I can not relax, feeling on edge. How foolish of me.</li>
<li>I hunger for Spring. For fresh air and sun.</li>
<li>Wishing I belonged somewhere.</li>
<li>At times I look at the dark sky and wonder what I'm missing. What radio signals are going through the air? What planes are flying where and what is life like for the people in them? It's strange, I know.</li>
<li>It is time to say good-bye. At least for now.</li>
