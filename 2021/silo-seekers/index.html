<h1 class="p-name">Silo Seekers</h1>
<p>10 February 2021</p>
<p>A culture of silo systems is an instiution killer. It doesn't matter if your for-profit or not-for-profit, if you'd co-operate working together by hiring the right people the sky isn't even the limit. If you want to move forward, management needs to become leaders or leave. There is no middle ground.</p>
<p>Stop pretending you know everything. You don't. That's why you hire people that know their field well. Let them do the job you hired them to do. Remove the obstacles, get out of their way, and stay out of their way. This isn't rocket surgery, it's incredibly easy, if you can stay hungry and humble.</p>
<p>It's difficult to find a boss that won't hold you down or put you down. You need one that looks out for you and brings you up. Someone who will take care of you and have your back. If you don't have that, there's no point in staying where you are. Find someplace where the people are great and what you do is greater than who you are.</p>
