<p>16 February 2021</p>
<p>Imagine this: you find out the requirements for a college class, read the syllabus, get the details of how the college runs its classes, and decide to enroll. You pay for the class and the time to drop the class for a full refund comes and goes. Then before the test the instructor changes the syllabus for the class. The terms are now changed. If the terms were that way in the first place you wouldn't have taken the class. It's too late for a refund. You either continue the class or drop it.</p>
<p>Isn't that called bait-and-switch?</p>
