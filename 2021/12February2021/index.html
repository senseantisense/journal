<ul>
<li>Already, twice this week I've wanted to tell people &quot;I can only explain it to you, I can't understand it for you&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="https://seths.blog/2020/08/toward-a-zoom-agreement/">Toward a Zoom agreement</a></li>
<li>I have problems trying to figure out situations that are ironic. I know that a fire truck on fire is irony. However, I think I have one. This week I read a blog post about a person's unsolicited rejection. So I started a conversation with them and the last email I sent was asking them how they keep going after such situations.  I have not heard back.</li>
<li>I've been a person who never could (wanted to?) fit in. I've tried to make work that I enjoyed and hoped that people would come along for the ride if they liked it. Now, I want to make a rukus. It'll make for an interesting year.</li>
