<h1 class="p-name">Thoughts from The Pursuit of Perfection</h1>
<p>17 February 2021</p>

<p>Fighting perfection is a prefect thing to fight. Why seek perfection? Because we want it so that no one can criticize it. It's perfect, so what could be wrong with it? It's our fear that someone will say something negative, even if that comment is wrong. Maybe it just doesn't matter what is said because it's not for them. At some point you need to throw it out there and learn if there's real failure.</p>
<p>As one English instructor taught me, if I had more time I would have written a shorter paper.</p>
