<h2 class="p-name"><a href="/2021/nothing-wrong-here/">Nothing Wrong Here</a></h2>
<p>18 February 2021</p>
<!-- 00:07 INBOUND15 +Seth+Godin+Spotlight.mp4 -->
<p>Organizations are obsessed with authority.<br /> ‚Äî Seth Godin</p>
<p>When people have a legitimate reason to be upset the way our institution does something we insist that there is nothing wrong here. We listen politely but hide in our bureaucracy of &quot;that's how it's always been&quot; or &quot;that's the rules&quot;. We insist there is nothing wrong here. We lie to ourselves and the people we serve. It would mean change to do it differently and that change causes fear to the drone authority structure. Because authority is there to serve itself. And that's why your institution doesn't matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://play.acast.com/s/akimbo/thepursuitofperfection">The pursuit of perfection</a></p>
<p>Fighting perfection is a prefect thing to fight. Why seek perfection? Because we want it so that no one can criticize it. It's perfect, so what could be wrong with it? It's our fear that someone will say something negative, even if that comment is wrong. Maybe it just doesn't matter what is said because it's not for them. At some point you need to throw it out there and learn if there's real failure.</p>
<p>As one English instructor taught me, if I had more time I would have written a shorter paper.</p>

<h2 class="p-name"><a href="/2021/bait-and-switch/">Bait-and-Switch</a></h2>
<p>16 February 2021</p>
<p>Imagine this: you find out the requirements for a college class, read the syllabus, get the details of how the college runs its classes, and decide to enroll. You pay for the class and the time to drop the class for a full refund comes and goes. Then before the test the instructor changes the syllabus for the class. The terms are now changed. If the terms were that way in the first place you wouldn't have taken the class. It's too late for a refund. You either continue the class or drop it.</p>
<p>Isn't that called bait-and-switch?</p>

<p>12 February 2021</p>
<p>There are instructors that seem to think that using a webcam to watch you during a test stops you from cheating on online exams. Webcams don't stop people from cheating. Cheaters cheat and honest people don't. It's not hard to figure out. Webcam use is for security theatre so the instructor feels better not to mention an invasion of privacy for the student.</p>

<p>11 February 2021</p>
<p>Looking at Phillipians 1, how great it is to see that there is a reason for suffering and to have trust in God. That's because of joy.</p>
<p>Seeking happiness and getting it can be great. Seeking joy is what bring life. Joy lasts, happiness doesn't. Happiness makes you feel better for a time. Joy is in your core and keeps you whole.</p>

<p><a href="https://seths.blog/2021/02/how-to-get-better-at-graphic-design/">Avoid the clown suit</a></p>
<p>We all work with a few people in clown suits. It frustrating and demeaning, but it happens. We all work with people suffering from Dunning-Kruger issues. But let's remember, we have our limitations too and should know them.</p>

<h2 class="p-name"><a href="/2021/silo-seekers/">Silo Seekers</a></h2>
<p>10 February 2021</p>
<p>A culture of silo systems is an instiution killer. It doesn't matter if your for-profit or not-for-profit, if you'd co-operate working together by hiring the right people the sky isn't even the limit. If you want to move forward, management needs to become leaders or leave. There is no middle ground.</p>
<p>Stop pretending you know everything. You don't. That's why you hire people that know their field well. Let them do the job you hired them to do. Remove the obstacles, get out of their way, and stay out of their way. This isn't rocket surgery, it's incredibly easy, if you can stay hungry and humble.</p>
<p>It's difficult to find a boss that won't hold you down or put you down. You need one that looks out for you and brings you up. Someone who will take care of you and have your back. If you don't have that, there's no point in staying where you are. Find someplace where the people are great and what you do is greater than who you are.</p>
