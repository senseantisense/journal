<h2 class="p-name">Remembrance</h2>
<p>3 March 2020</p>
<p>Romanticizing about the past can be comforting and has both its pros and cons. Hearing from the past can give great comfort, flashbacks to what we think were simpler times, and that hit of nostalgia is pleasant. What's frustrating is not remembering clear enough whether it was a simpler time. The memories are clouded from that much detail. The sensations are there from what you are listening too, but the pain that must have been there during the same time period of life, not necessarily from the experience of the sound (or smell or visual), must have been too. Perhaps one should take it as it is, something happily remembered. And be thankful that the pain isn't remembered.</p>
