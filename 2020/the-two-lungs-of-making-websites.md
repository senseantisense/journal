There are two lungs to making websites: User Experience and Content.

If you take one away you still have a website, but like breathing with just one lung life is much more difficult. Everything stems from those two items. They both have many parts but both are needed for a great website.

The lists give an example of how it can be divided between groups. Many terms came from Jesse James Garrett's [The Elements of User Experience](http://www.jjg.net/elements/).

### Content
* Content Requirements
* Copy Writing
* Site Objectives
* User Needs

### User Experience
* Accessibility
* Functional Specifications
* Information Architecture
* Information Design
* Interaction Design
* Interface Design
* Navigation Design
* Performance (which determines technology used)
* Visual Design
