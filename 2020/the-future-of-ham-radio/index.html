<h2 class="p-name">The Future of Ham Radio</h2>
<p>11 March 2020</p>
<p>After years of not being in the hobby of ham radio I've gotten a bit of an interest in it again. And after all those years the myth of the future of ham radio is still &quot;the youth&quot;. (Well, it's now the future and that has been the battle cry for decades, how's it going?) The solution is that the future of ham radio is to work as a community to support each other, regardless of age or any other discriminatory agenda. The whole &quot;youth are our future&quot; is keeping so many others out of the hobby. When a new person comes into ham radio there is not as much help nor interest in helping them if they are out of childhood. Why?</p>
