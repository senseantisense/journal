<h2 class="p-name">What I See</h2>
<p>3 February 2020</p>
<p>I like to observe. To see what is going on around me. What I see is written below.</p>
<p>So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed. (Ephesians 4:17-19 | NIV)</p>
