<h1 class="p-name">Weekly - 6 November 2020</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is most amusing to have people complain about social media's intrusion into life, including lack of privacy, then turn around and use it to reveal so much about themselves to the world.</li>
<li>Why has no one made &quot;The Tripods&quot; into a movie trilogy?</li>
<li>Paul's faith astounds me.</li>
<li>Seeing more sites who state that if the reader sees an error, like spelling or a broken link, to submit an issue via GitHub. No, I'm not going to waste my time. Your site just isn't that important and you can live with the issue. Accept my email or not, don't care.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/magazine/societal-collapse.html">How Do You Know When Society Is About to Fall Apart?</a></li>
<li>It is disheartening that as a society people are being used everyday by media.</li>
<li><a href="https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-us-inability-to-count-votes-is">The U.S. Inability To Count Votes is a National Disgrace. And Dangerous.</a></li>
<li>A day of confusion and being lost. Just feeling broken. The weight is too heavy right now.</li>
<li>Maybe days are broken and not me. ;0</li>
<li>Am I worthy to even see a shadow of those things to come or those things that can be known? No.</li>
<li>Discovered and listening to Cowboy Bebop soundtracks today. I can't believe they're finally available! &quot;Let's kick the beat&quot; (Mushroom Hunting by SEATBELTS).</li>
