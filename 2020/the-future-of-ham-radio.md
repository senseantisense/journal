After years of not being in the hobby of ham radio I've gotten a bit of an interest in it again. And after all those years the myth of the future of ham radio is still "the youth". (Well, it's now the future and that has been the battle cry for decades, how's it going?) The solution is that the future of ham radio is to work as a community to support each other, regardless of age or any other discriminatory agenda. The whole "youth are our future" is keeping so many others out of the hobby. When a new person comes into ham radio there is not as much help nor interest in helping them if they are out of childhood. Why?
