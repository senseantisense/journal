<p>-<a href="https://mcbroken.com/">mcbroken</a> - Need this for ICEE machines too.</p>
<p>-Put up a logo on <a href="https://senseantisense.com/">SenseAntisense</a> yesterday, finally.</p>
<p>-Amazing how websites are jumping on the Dark Mode bandwagon.</p>
<p>-&quot;Error: filter not found: rssLastUpdatedDate&quot; - At what point do I give up trying to setup RSS with Eleventy? Maybe now?</p>
<p>-<a href="https://2020.indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp 2020</a> - Nice to see the IndieWeb still going strong.</p>

<p>-AURORA released a cover of &quot;Thank U&quot;.</p>

<p>-There have been a lot of weeks lately that all I do is fight my computers/devices and various websites because of such bad user experience. Operating systems are giant malware/spyware. And don't get me started on the constant reminders for me to sign-up or do things to my computer that I just don't want nor need.</p>
<p>-And I'm still waiting for the robot I was promised when I was a kid. The one everyone was going to have by years ago?</p>
<p>-Having problems with the new Photoshop 2021 upgrade? Getting a dialog box that says &quot;Could not complete your create due to a program error&quot;? After a couple of days I found out how to solve the issue. This is also an error that has popped up for various other reasons over the years. But the solution I got and worked was on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/jf4uvd/photoshop_2021_could_not_complete_your_create_due/">Reddit</a>: &quot;Keep using your current GPU and version of PS but disable GPU in preferences &gt; performance &gt; use graphics processor OFF&quot;.</p>
<p>-<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-intro-containers/docker-cli/">Use Steve Jobs’s 30% Rule to Enter Your “Golden Age”</a></p>
<p>-People complaining they need to do closed captioning for a video because they have a deadline just makes them sound callous.</p>
<p>-<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/among-sus">Among Us as text adventure</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Wanted to do infosuicide so many times, but I'm still here. UGH! :)</li>
</ul>
<p>-I listen to so few male artists and no rap but NF is just great.</p>
<p>-At times, when I look up at the night sky, I wonder what signals are out there. What's happening on radio frequencies we usually don't listen to. What's going on in the rest of our solar system? Would it be lonely to be drifting in space? Imagine drifting past Pluto. Is there someone, somewhere staring up at their sky wondering if there is life elsewhere? <a href="https://neue.bandcamp.com/album/the-planets">Neue</a> has a good soundtrack for this.</p>
