<h2>My Personal Information</h2>
<p>4 March 2020</p>
<p>I received an unsolicited invite today from an individual to join a discussion on a third party corporate site. I went to the site and there was my real name. Without being asked, my personal information is shared with a company I have no desire to have said information shared with. It fascinates me that people don't just ask before doing.</p>
<p>I logged in and deactivated my account. Nope, can't delete it.</p>
<p>And if you do not understand my concern, please go to your local library and find a book on 20th century history. One concerning Europe and/or the United States of America should do nicely.</p>
