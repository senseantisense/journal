<ul>
<li>I have a best friend. Her name is Emma. If it wasn't for her I'd be friendless. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here. Thank you Emma. I love you!</li>
<li>Feeling a bit lost, but a bit found.</li>
<li>Listening to the album &quot;Liturgy&quot; by &quot;Makeup And Vanity Set&quot;.</li>
<li>Today is Wednesday. Things are OK this week. Reading James and more commentary about Benedict helps sooth the soul. With some McLuhan speaking thrown in for fun.</li>
<li>On the aforementioned &quot;Liturgy&quot; album, track 10, &quot;Pasaje&quot;, is just brilliant.</li>
<li>What cheerfulness the sun brings after days of cloudiness. Like being in a cold room warmed by a pile of blankets.</li>
<li>It's hard at times not to think of humans as inherently bad but it's worth the fight not to think that.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical">The withering email that got an ethical AI researcher fired at Google</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.saintmeinrad.edu/seminary-blog/echoes-from-the-bell-tower/pandemic-lessons-from-a-monastery/">Pandemic: Lessons From a Monastery</a></li>
<li>Happy Christmas!</li>
<li>It seems like everytime I find something interesting it turns out a person needs years of education to get into the topic.</li>
