<li>Why is it so hard to find the type of music that I'm looking for? It doesn't matter what type it is, why is it so difficult?</li>
<li>I forget what silence sounds like.</li>
<li>Does life happen at the fringes of society?</li>
<li>Remember: what I say is nothing. The future is not null.</li>

<li>Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2 | NIV)</li>
<li>Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. (Romans 12:9-10 | NIV)</li>

<li>I'm amazed at how there's such a difference between people's glamour photos and what a person really looks like.</li>

<li>Are <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=luddite">luddites</a> (definition 1) real? Or is it used as an adjective to ignore people with different goals and lives? It also seems to be a term used by &quot;in-the-know&quot; speakers to describe people and then followed by the speaker complaining about the same things luddites claim to be upset about. Based on a talk some years ago there is a small group of luddites (as the speaker states) that don't own smartphones. In that case, I was a luddite at one point but not for the reasons the speaker thinks. It was because I couldn't afford a smartphone.</li>
<li>Romans 12 hits hard against what humanity is.</li>
<li>&quot;…I made the regrettable decision to download TikTok. And… wow I can see why it's popular. It's like a dopamine drip feed…&quot; <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/25/Recently-October-25/">Recently - October 25</a></li>

<li>&quot;I'm with Stupid&quot; by Pet Shop Boys never fails to amuse.</li>
<li>It's funny that sometimes people cannot notice noise until it stops.</li>
<li>And let's add Romans 13 on that list of hitting hard against what humanity is.</li>
<li>Higher Education continues to be sliding into group think.</li>

<li>What the world does not know: &quot;So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.&quot; (Romans 14:12 | NIV).</li>
<li>I don't know why it amazes me the lack of customer service that is wide spread (with very little exceptions).</li>
<li>Why would you create a magazine/journal and not tell how to subscribe? I want to give you money but you are telling me no.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=40058">Wobblepaint</a> - Thank you for making me smile.</li>
<li>Seems so much longer ago than 4 years that I quit Twitter. So thankful that I'm not using social media.</li>
<li>Inaction is a struggle. Silence is a noise.</li>

<li>How is it that people are so blind that they don't understand that they are being used by political parties and corporations for the sake of money and power?</li>
<li>I was once told that when voting you need to pick the lesser of two evils. No, I don't have to vote for evil.</li>
