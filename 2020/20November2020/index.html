<ul>
<li>Why do I write this?</li>
<li>So much anger in the world. So much confusion and &quot;wisdom&quot;. So much hypocricy. It's all getting to me and there is no reason that it should.</li>
<li>I miss playing.</li>
<li>The Web is not a disappointment. Humanity is.</li>
<li>If we only talked about things we actually knew about the world would be so much quieter.</li>
<li>The word &quot;unprecedented&quot; has lost all meaning.</li>
<li>If you need to create a video to explain how to do something on your website, there's a problem with the website.</li>
<li>None of this matters except the Father above. Whom people have lost all fear and remembrance of.</li>
<li>When online shopping goes well it goes well. But when it goes bad, it really goes bad.</li>
<li><a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a> - this looks promising.</li>
<li>Until you are blocked from sites outside your country you don't realize how many resources you depend upon that are outside of your country.</li>
<li>Finding articulate (free) instruction on a topic of choice is difficult.</li>
<li>I have so much to improve on.</li>
<li>It's a &quot;Salt of the Sound&quot; music kind of day.</li>
<li>Have you brought me this far only to abandon me? I think not!</li>
<li>So tired of fighting technology. Good usability doesn't exist in 90%+ of experiences. Trying to pump gas is a chore.</li>
<li>If self-help paperbacks, classes, and speeches are the only way forward I'm fine where I'm at.</li>
<li>How can peace of mind be so hard to find? Or is it that we are too lazy to search for it?</li>
<li>In my heart I know of saints not officially canonized. Do you have any?</li>
<li>If you want an institutional and legalistic answer ask a diocesan priest but if you want a heartfelt answer and an understanding ear ask a monk.</li>
<li>There can be and is only one Truth. (In reference to the Great (East-West) Schism.)</li>
